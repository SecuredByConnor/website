			<h1>Hello! </h1>
			<p>
				Hi — I’m Connor Stevenson Forrester. 
				
			</p>
				This is my hands‑on cybersecurity lab journal: a place where I publish step‑by‑step write‑ups from HackTheBox Academy/Labs/CTF, PortSwigger Web Security Academy, The Odin Project and other practical exercises, along with Python automation projects. 
			<p>
				Each post focuses on process and learning — clear enumeration, exploit methodology, remediation advice, and short “lessons learned” sections — with code snippets and payloads where appropriate. 
			<p>
				If you’re interested in the technical details or want to collaborate, check out my projects on GitHub or get in touch via the links above.
