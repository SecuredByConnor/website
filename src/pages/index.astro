			<h1>Hello! </h1>
			
			</p>
				Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. My name is Connor, and I’m a recent graduate with hands-on experience in penetration testing, security analysis, and technical support. During my degree, I completed a year-long industry placement as a Penetration Tester, where I worked on real engagements, conducted vulnerability assessments, and gained practical experience with a wide range of tools, methodologies, and reporting standards. Alongside this, I’ve worked as both a 1st Line and 2nd Line Support Engineer across two different companies, giving me strong troubleshooting skills, experience with enterprise environments, and a deep understanding of how systems fail, how attackers exploit them, and how to fix issues under pressure.
			<p>
				I enjoy applying what I learn in practical challenges and team events. In 2024, I represented my university in the HTB University CTF competition, where our team placed 292nd out of 1,128 teams — a great experience that strengthened my problem-solving skills and broadened my understanding of real-world attack chains. 
			<p>
				I started this blog in November 2025 to document my ongoing technical development. Here, I publish detailed write-ups of the labs I complete from PortSwigger’s Web Security Academy, HTB Academy, and other practical training platforms. Each write-up focuses on methodology, what I learned, and how the technique applies to real-world security testing. This portfolio is designed not just to demonstrate what I’ve completed, but to show my approach to problem-solving, analysis, and continuous learning as I build my skills toward a full-time role in offensive security.
			<p>
				Thanks for visiting — I update this site regularly as I complete more labs, challenges, and personal projects.
